# Tippa

A very simple application that calculates how much one should tip at the end of their meal.

# How it Works

Simply input your total (pre-tax) into the input field, select at what percent you want to tip (I used a dropdown menu with 15, 18, and 20 percents as they're the most common), and then how many people are splitting the bill, and then the app will tell you how much to tip.

In the future, I'm planning on having the app show the total with tax and tip included, as well as an option to round to the nearest whole dollar.
